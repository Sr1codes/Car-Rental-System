# Car Rental System Database in mySQL
This is my final project on creating a car rental management database in mySQL. It models a car rental business. I added sample data and tables for the customers, cars, rentals, staff, payments, maintenance, reviews, insurance.

This database handles:

Customer Management

- Car Inventory + Features

- Rental Locations

- Rental Transactions

- Payments + Insurance

- Maintenance Logs

- Staff Directory

- Customer Reviews

- Views, Queries, Triggers, and Stored Procedures

## Tables presented
| `Customers`       | Stores info about people renting cars                        |

| `Cars`            | Car inventory with status (Available, Rented, Maintenance)   |

| `Locations`       | Rental locations with addresses and contact info             |

| `Rentals`         | Every rental event (who, what, where, when, and how much)    |

| `Payments`        | Tracks how payments were made and how much                   |

| `Maintenance`     | Maintenance logs for cars needing repairs                    |

| `Insurance`       | Details about insurance coverage per rental                  |

| `Staff`           | Employee roster (whoâ€™s working where)                        |

| `Reviews`         | Star ratings + text reviews from customers                   |

| `VehicleFeatures` | Shows off the features of the car like sunroofs and autopilot|

| `CarStatusLogs`   | Logs whenever a car's status changes (via the Trigger)       |

## Functions, Views, Procedure and Trigger
- The stored procedure calculates the total rental cost based on the number of days and daily rate, and updates the rental record.
- The Trigger logs any changes to the status of Cars. For ex, when a car is rented or returned. 
- Lastly, the Function computes the total revenue from all rentals.
- The views allow to quick access to see all customers, cars, rentals, payments, etc.

## Queries
- Using the queries, you can show rental details for a specific customer.
- Show the total spending and number of rentals for each customer.
- List all cars that are currently rented.
