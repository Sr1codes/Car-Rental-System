# Car Rental System Database
This is my project on creating a car rental management database in mySQL. It models a car rental business. I added mock data and tables for the customers, cars, rentals, staff, payments, maintenance, reviews, insurance.

This database handles:

Customer Management

- Car Inventory + Features

- Rental Locations

- Rental Transactions

- Payments + Insurance

- Maintenance Logs

- Staff Directory

- Customer Reviews

- Views, Queries, Triggers, and Stored Procedures
